## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) - Markup language for structuring the app.
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Styling the UI for responsive and animated designs.

**Backend:**
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Authentication and real-time database (optional).
